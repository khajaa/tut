**Timer
#contents
***Example
This callback must be recursive.
Call a function and it sets another interval at the end of the function.
This one refresh screen every 40 milliseconds which is corresponds to around 25 fps.
Create a function
 void Timer( int value ) {
   glutPostRedisplay();
   glutTimerFunc(40,Timer,0);
 }
In main
 glutTimerFunc(40,Timer,0);
You can pass a global variable as a counter, then increment in the function.

In order to calculate fps, combine with idle function. glutPostRedisplay() 
will be in the idling function.
