**Fixing Tips
#contents
***1. Vertical centering with line-height

line-height:24px;

When you have a container with fixed height you can use line-height property to vertically center the content.
***2. Prevent oversized content to break fixed width floated layouts

	#main{
		overflow:hidden;
	}

When oversized content (i.e. wide image) is placed in fixed width floated container, it may break the layout. To prevent that use this trick. It will hide a part of the content but at least your layout structure will remain intact.
I wrote an article about it a while back.
***3. Prevent line breaks in links

	a{
		white-space:nowrap;
	}

This little trick will prevent line breaks on your links. I recommend using this with long text to avoid having links break into 2 lines.
***4. Always show Firefox scrollbar

	html{
		overflow:-moz-scrollbars-vertical;
	}

Firefox hides vertical scrollbar by default. So, when you browse a site that have different page heights you notice a horizontal shift. This code will always display a scrollbar and prevent shifting.
***5. Centering block elements horizontally

	margin:0 auto;

For all modern browser this line of css is enough to horizontally center a block level element.
***6. Remove vertical textarea scrollbar in IE

	textarea{
		overflow:auto;
	}

Textareas in IE have vertical scrollbar visible by default. If you want those removed (I know I do) use this line.
***7. Force page breaks when printing your document

	h2{
		page-break-before:always;
	}

With this line of code you can control places where you want your pages to break when printing a document.
***8. Remove active link borders

	a:active, a:focus{
		outline:none;
	}
