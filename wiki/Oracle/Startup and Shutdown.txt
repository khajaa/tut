***Introduction
Oracle startup its database in this order
+Reading spfile
+Reading Control File
+Mounting Database
+Open Database



***Startup / Shutdown database
 sqlplus / as sysdba
 
Read $ORACLE_HOME/dbs/spfile(INSTANCE).ora
 startup nomount;

Read $ORACLE_HOME/dbs/spfile(INSTANCE).ora - > Control File
 startup mount;

Read $ORACLE_HOME/dbs/spfile(INSTANCE).ora - > Control File -> Data
This is most frequently used
 startup;


In order to shutdown,
Wait until all connecitons are gone
 shutdown;

Just ignore all connections and shutdown - most frequently used
 shutdown immediate;

Emergency, kill all job
 shutdown abort;

***spfile and pfile
spfile is binary format and it's used to startup oracle.
In order to edit spfile, you have to export into pfile which is text format,
and after editing spfile, compile into binary file format again.
in sqlplus
 create pfile='/tmp/test.ora' from spfile

 create spfile='$ORACLE_HOME/dbs/spfile(INSTANCE).ora' from pfile='/tmp/test.ora'

So if you change some configuration, and oracle does not start up, edit spfile and remove suspicious lines.
