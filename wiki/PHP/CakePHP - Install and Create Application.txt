+Access
 http://localhost/mysite/comments/

***Memo

For mac, you might have to specify 127.0.0.1 it did not work with localhost somehow. sqlite3 did not work either...

If mod_rewrite is not working, add index.php

 /index.php/app/method/

e.g
 http://192.168.1.101/~kiichi/test/cake/index.php/tasks

or
 http://192.168.1.101/~kiichi/test/cake/tasks/
 http://192.168.1.101/~kiichi/test/cake/index.php/tasks/view/1


***Without mod_rewrite
In /app/config/core.php, uncomment the line that looks like:
 Configure::write('App.baseUrl', env('SCRIPT_NAME'));

Also remove these .htaccess files:

		/.htaccess
		/app/.htaccess
		/app/webroot/.htaccess
