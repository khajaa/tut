***Copy row to another table
Assume table 1 and table 2 are identical, and table1 does not hold "identity" column which automatically increment the value.
 INSERT INTO table1 SELECT * FROM table2
 INSERT INTO table1 (col1,col2,col3) SELECT col1,col2,col3 FROM table2

This is useful when you take a snapshot as a log. If you add additional column, (In this case, table1 has ''LogDate'' as extra column)
 INSERT INTO table1 SELECT GETDATE(), * FROM table2

The easiest way to copy a table is that you generate sql from one table and replace the table name, then insert as a sql.

***TOP
Use TOP to limit number of return rows
 SELECT TOP 10 * FROM table1;

This is important to reduce the number of the transaction

***USE
 USE MyDB
USE is useful when you write a batch sql file or without any Initial Catalog phrase in your connection string.


***Transaction
 BEGIN TRANSACTION
 INSERT INTO ListCar (IsActive) VALUES (1);
 SELECT IDENT_CURRENT('ListCar');
    IF @@ERROR <> 0
       BEGIN
           RAISERROR('error occured', 16, 1)
           ROLLBACK
       END
 COMMIT TRANSACTION

***Top1 of each GROUP BY
Use MAS to pickup the first one within the group
 SELECT Max(CustomerName) AS SampleCustomer, COUNT(Category) FROM Sales GROUP BY Category
