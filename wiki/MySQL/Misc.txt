***REPLACE
REPLACE is just like UPDATE, but if the value does not exist, it will INSERT.
 REPLACE INTO mytable (id, val) VALUES('1','test')

***LIMIT
In MySQL, use LIMIT to limit number of rows to return from select statement.
 SELECT * FROM mytable LIMIT 5

If you need only one row, make sure always to put LIMIT phrase to avoid unnecessarly transaction.


This is very useful to reduce steps.
