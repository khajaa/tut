 (:searchresults:)
     Produces the results of a search in a wikipage, as coming from the q= URL parameter or a (:searchbox:) directive.

 See markup variables for a complete list of "variables" that you can access through the markup construction {$<variable>}. Here are some of the available variables.
 {$Name} - The page's name, as in "SpecialMarkups"

 {$DefaultGroup} - The name of the default (startup) group, here it's "Main"
 {$Title} - the page's title, as in "Other special markups"

 (:redirect GroupName.PageName:)

 Misc Bracket Abuse
 
 [[<<]]
     Forces a line break, specifically inserts the HTML "<br clear='all'>" 
 (:spacewikiwords:)
     Place this directive in a page and it will cause all of the WikiWords 
 in the page to be displayed with spaces. This can also be turned on by 
 setting $SpaceWikiWords=1 in customization (see PmWiki.Variables). 
 [[#anchorname]]
     Creates an anchor in a page. 
 [[#anchorname|text]]
     Creates a link to an anchor within the same page.
