##Misc

###REPLACE
REPLACE is just like UPDATE, but if the value does not exist, it will INSERT.
```mysql
 ```
###LIMIT
In MySQL, use LIMIT to limit number of rows to return from select statement.
```mysql
 ```
If you need only one row, make sure always to put LIMIT phrase to avoid unnecessarly transaction.


This is very useful to reduce steps.
