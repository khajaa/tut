##CakePHP - Install and Create Application

###Install win
+Install XAMPP (If you do not have LAMP environment)
+Go to apache\conf\httpd.conf and remove comment for mod_rewrite
+Download CakePHP package and unzip under htdocs

###Creating Project win
+Create a database and a table 
In this example, I create a table it's called "Comments" that has id and comment column.
+Create Project
```php
 cd c:\xampp\htdocs\mysite
 c:\xampp\php\php.exe C:\xampp\htdocs\cake\scripts\bake.php -project mytest
 ```
```php
 ```
```php
 ```


###New isntructions
Is this changed?
```php
 php cake/console/bake.php bake all
 ```
###


###Memo

For mac, you might have to specify 127.0.0.1 it did not work with localhost somehow. sqlite3 did not work either...

If mod_rewrite is not working, add index.php

```php
 ```
e.g
```php
 ```
or
```php
 http://192.168.1.101/~kiichi/test/cake/index.php/tasks/view/1
 ```

###Without mod_rewrite
In /app/config/core.php, uncomment the line that looks like:
```php
 ```
Also remove these .htaccess files:

```php
 	/app/.htaccess
 	/app/webroot/.htaccess
 ```
